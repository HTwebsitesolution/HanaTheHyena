**Ages:** 6+

## How to use this guide

Choose a few questions from each section rather than trying to use them all at once. Keep questions open-ended so children can explore their own ideas and feelings. Research shows that open questions and before/during/after prompts deepen comprehension and support rich conversation around picture books.

---

## Before reading

Use these before opening the book or after a quick "picture walk" through a few spreads.

- Look at the cover. Who do you think Hana is, and what might be important to her?

- The story takes place in Ethiopia, in Harar and Addis Ababa. What do you already know about cities or countries that are different from where you live?

- Have you ever gone somewhere that felt much bigger or busier than your home (a new school, city, country, or even a big shop)? How did you feel before you went?

---

## While reading

Pause on key moments to check in with children's thinking and feelings.

### Arriving in Addis

- What do you notice about the city when Hana first arrives? How is it different from Harar?

- How do you think Hana feels in this scene? What do you see in the pictures that makes you say that?

### Feeling small on the street

- No one seems to notice Hana at first. Have you ever felt invisible or left out in a group? What helped, or what would have helped?

- What could the people in the city do to help someone new feel welcome?

### The dinner invitation

- Why do you think the family decides to invite Hana home for dinner? What does this tell you about them?

- What might Hana be thinking as she follows them to their house?

### Sharing food and traditions

- What new foods does Hana see on the table? Which dish would you like to try, and why?

- When Hana offers a piece of raw meat, what is she trying to show or share? How do the family respond kindly even though they eat differently at home?

### Going home again

- On the way back to Harar, how do you think Hana feels now compared to when she first left home?

- If you could ask Hana one question about her adventure, what would you ask?

---

## After reading

Use these to reflect on the whole story and connect it to children's lives.

- What is one brave thing Hana does in the story? What is one brave thing you have done, even if it felt small?

- How did the family show hospitality and kindness to Hana? What are some simple ways we can welcome someone new to our class, neighbourhood, or community?

- Hana learns that it is okay to be different and still belong. Can you think of a time when being different was a good thing?

- If you could add one more scene to the book, what would happen next in Hana's story?

## Extend the learning

**Food and culture:** Invite children to draw or list foods that are special in their own families. Talk about how sharing food can be a way of sharing love and culture.

**Feelings timeline:** Ask children to sketch quick faces for Hana at different moments (dreaming in Harar, arriving in Addis, standing alone, being invited to dinner, walking home). Which feeling do they relate to most?

**Acts of welcome:** As a group, create a "Welcome Plan" with 3–5 concrete things your class or family will do to help someone new feel included.
